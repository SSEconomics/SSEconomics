### Hi, I'm Stephen. 👋

I am an economist specializing in empirical macroeconomics, forecasting, and structural modelling.

**My goal is to improve lives by distributing resources that elevate the quality of economic analysis.**

I share open-source code, data, and workflows to help researchers bridge the gap between academic theory and practical application. My work covers a wide range of topics—from **central banking** and **high-frequency macro** to **structural analysis**—with a strict focus on automation and reproducibility.
